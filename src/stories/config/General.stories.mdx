# Configuration

This file will describe the possible content of the `config` object, or the object you pass to the constructor `new SurveyTool()` or `tool.updateConfig()` function.

There are 5 parts to a configuration object:

| Field name | Data type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | Unique key to differentiate between multiple surveys / configs, see below, |
| `theme` | [theme](https://github.com/tuur29/surveytool/blob/master/src/utils/theme.ts) | **Optional**, object containing all or some colors, font family / sizes, breakpoints and spacing, see below. |
| `labels` | [labels](https://github.com/tuur29/surveytool/blob/master/src/utils/labels.ts) | **Optional**, a key value map containing all or some labels in tool |
| `groups` | [question group array](https://github.com/tuur29/surveytool/blob/master/src/types/QuestionTypes.ts) | Required, complex structure containing all question(groups) parameters |
| `results` | [results object](https://github.com/tuur29/surveytool/blob/master/src/types/ConfigTypes.ts#L15) | **Optional**, object containing settings related to the way the results of the form are handled / displayed |

## Config id

Every configuration should have a unique id. The id is used for the following:

- A user's answers are saved locally when they are filling in the form. Their progress is saved, so a reload doesn't clear their input. This data is saved based on the id.
- When configured, saving the users data to a server will also include the config id so the backend knows which form is being saved.

> Because of this, reusing an id between different configurations might result in client side crashes!  
> However this only happens when the question array is changed.

## Theming

You can change any or all of the possible colors used in the tool by supplying a (partial) theme in the configuration. Additionally you can choose to start from a predefined dark theme as a base by supplying `darkMode: true`:

The theme is based on [Styled System](https://styled-system.com/). It consists of the following properties:

| Field name | Data type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `colors` | object | A list of every color used in the app |
| `fonts` | object | Allows you to set different title & text fonts in the tool |
| `sizes` | object | Contains pixel values for borders, fontSizes... |
| `space` | int[] | A list of pixel values to ensure consistent spacing |
| `breakpoints` | object | Key value map containing pixel values for `xs, sm, md, lg, xl` breakpoints |
| (`zIndex`) | object | Key value map containing all used `z-index` values (probably should not be changed) |
| (`elevation`) | object | Key value map containing the level of shadow beneath some components (probably should not be changed) |

Example:

```js
tool.updateConfig({ ...tool.config,
    theme: {
        darkMode: true,
        values: {
            colors: { controlHighlight: "#ff00ff" },
            sizes: { radius: "0px" },
            fonts: { title: "Serif" },
            breakpoints: { md: "600px" }
        }
    }
});
```
